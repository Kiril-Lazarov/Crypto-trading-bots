# Crypto-trading-bots
This project is a collection of my programs for automatic cryptocurrency trading. Some of the programs are test-based, others carry out real transactions in real time. The crypto exchange where trading takes place is Binance. All programs are designed for trading 24/7. I run these programs on my PythonAnywhere account.
